	<p class="blocktext">HANNAH'S JUICY BITS is an organic juice company that started in February 2016 in the quaint town of St Andrews.
	<br>
	<br>
	After being fed up of buying mass processed supermarket orange juices, our founder one day decided to make a big jug of freshly squeezed orange juice for her and her flatmate. And that's where HANNAH'S JUICY BITS was born. Yes, it was <i>that</i> simple!
	<br>
	<br>
	Our goal is to offer a fresh and nutritious alternative to store bought juices, allowing you to integrate more of your 5 a day into your diet.
	<br>
	<br>
	All of our ingredients are certified organic and have been locally sourced.
	<br>
	<br>
	The result is a menu of juices jam packed with organic goodness that will fill you with sustainable energy.</p>
